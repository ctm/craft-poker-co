# [Craftpoker.com](https://craftpoker.com/)

## Truly social, really fun

While Craft Poker Co. is the company that encompasses all forms of
monetization of [mb2](https://ctm.github.io/docs/players_manual/),
craftpoker.com will be a site dedicated to friendly but competitive
poker for [Fun
Money](https://ctm.github.io/docs/players_manual/fun_money.html)
(i.e. a way of keeping score).

## Possible details

None of what is written here is guaranteed. The overall plan of having
craftpoker.com be supported via membership fees and not selling
information, advertising or selling Fun Money is unlikely to change.

Craftpoker.com will likely allow people to play for free, either solo
or as a member of a single club. Paying members will likely be able to
create their own clubs or simply belong to more than one pre-existing
club.

Craftpoker.com will not sell anyone's information and will collect as
little information as possible. Club managers will be in charge of how
Fun Money is allocated for their club. Free players playing solo will
only be able to gain a certain amount of free chips per some duration
so that there will be some incentive for free players to play to win
and not simply to spew chips.

The fee structure that I propose is:

* If you play for free and are not a member of a club, you are only
limited to events (tournaments and ring games) that allow free
players, which will be a small fraction of what's dealt on
craftpoker.com.

* If you play for free and are a member of the club, you can play
everything a free solo player can play and anything that the club
manager allows you to play in that club. Club managers will typically
have a limit on the number of players in their club and will be able
to kick club members out at will (although not in the middle of a
tournament). If you are kicked out of a club craftpoker.com will remember
your club statistics, but they will not be available until you are
re-instated.  If you want to play in a different club, you can choose
to leave the club you're in when you're accepted to that other club.

* If you pay $5/month, you can be in as many clubs simultaneously as
 you want and your statistics remain available.
 
* Additionally, your $5/month allows you to organize one club and to have
nine other members in that club. As a club organizer you will be able to
choose whether to admit others and to kick them out (although not in
the middle of a tournament).  If you want your club to be larger, you
can pay $5*N/month to allow your club to have 10*N simultaneous members.

The above is hastily worded, subject to change, etc., but the basic idea
is that people will be able to play for free, but it's probably more fun
to play as a member of at least one club.
