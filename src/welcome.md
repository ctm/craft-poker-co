# Welcome

Craft Poker Co. is a Nevada C corporation, founded by me, [Cliff
Matthews](https://ctm.github.io/docs/the_person/).

This book documents some thoughts and plans associated with the company.
Nothing within constitutes an offer, promise or in any other way obliges
Craft Poker Co. or Cliff Matthews to do anything. This book is not a
contract or any other type of legal document.

These half-baked business ideas are here so that when I share them,
people can know that I'm telling the same story to everyone and, should
they be especially curious, they can even go back and see the revision
history.

I may wind up having to take this book down, due to potential issues
related to the _perception_ of gambling. Additionally, my blunt goal
of trying to get Craft Poker Co.'s valuation to $100MM might cause
trouble.  The easiest solution to these problems is to remove this
document from `ctm.github.io`, but to keep the repository of its
source available so that anyone who wants to can see what I've said
previously.

Craft Poker Co. has no intention to violate any laws or regulations,
or to cause liability problems for anyone.
