# A Public Life

I've not always been a public person and I still find it a bit
unnerving.  However&mdash;and it's really hard for me to objectively
evaluate&mdash;I believe I benefit from putting the various things
on GitHub that I do and this is a continuation of that process.


I don't know for sure that I want to put a bunch of half-baked
business ideas out for people to see, but the nice thing about doing
it this way is that when I share a link here, people can know that I'm
telling the same story to everyone and should the be especially
curious, they can go back and even see the revision history.
