# Preface

I have hastily written this document and it is not fit for _general_
consumption.

On April 18th, 2019, I began writing
[mb2](https://ctm.github.io/docs/players_manual/): a set of poker
software, comprising a server, client and various libraries shared
between the two. I have had three friends invest in Craft Poker
Co. and I anticipate many more will do so, albeit probably through an
equity crowdfunding portal.

When I started work, I planned on "quickly" generating a
proof-of-concept with a traditional emphasis on minimal viable product
(MVP) features. My plan was to raise money so I could pay people to do
the things that I either couldn't do, or I'd do poorly or that could
be done by someone much less expensive than myself. I had no intention
of creating even the MVP solo.

However, as I was doing that, covid-19 struck and as I was waiting it
out I did more of the things I had planned on not doing. Additionally,
I added obscure features that were not required for a minimally viable
product and deferred features that were. As such, more than three
years later the software is lop-sided, with a lot of cool features,
but with an unstyled (and that's a polite way of putting it) user
interface.
