# Executive Summary
My goal is to get Craft Poker Co's valuation to $100MM[^1].

Initial revenue through 
- craftpoker.com play-money site
- white labeled sites
- partnerships

Eventual revenue through real money sites

[^1]: This nice round number is akin to [running a hundred
miler](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=79879#id220546). I.e.,
it's not a sprint and it's not even a marathon.  As such, it takes a
different amount of time and preparation than either.
