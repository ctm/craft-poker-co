# Executive Summary
My goal is to get Craft Poker Co.'s valuation to $100MM[^1].

Initial revenue through 
- craftpoker.com play-money site
- white labeled play-money sites
- partnerships (again, using play-money)

I anticipate eventual revenue through real money sites, but the
regulatory hurdles for that are steep and numerous. The initial
bootstrapping of Craft Poker Co. will done purely through play-money
business, where we hope to become the acknowledged world leader of
play-money poker.  During this time, regulations will change. They may
loosen in some locales and may tighten in others.

No money raised via the equity crowdfunding portal will be spent
developing, or in any other way supporting, directly or indirectly,
gambling (i.e., real money play).  However, after Craft Poker Co. has
become the industry leader in play-money poker, it is likely that it
will have the revenue to thoroughly investigate the regulations, current
and proposed, and determine the feasibility of supporting real-money
play in whichever, if any, locales it can do so legally and profitably.

[^1]: This nice round number is akin to [running a hundred
miler](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=79879#id220546). I.e.,
it's not a sprint and it's not even a marathon.  As such, it takes a
different amount of time and preparation than either.
