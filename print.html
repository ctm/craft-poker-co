<p>Craft Poker Co. is a Nevada C corporation, founded by me, <a href="https://ctm.github.io/docs/the_person/">Cliff
Matthews</a>.</p>
<p>This book documents some thoughts and plans associated with the company.
Nothing within constitutes an offer, promise or in any other way obliges
Craft Poker Co. or Cliff Matthews to do anything. This book is not a
contract or any other type of legal document.</p>
<p>These half-baked business ideas are here so that when I share them,
people can know that I'm telling the same story to everyone and, should
they be especially curious, they can even go back and see the revision
history.</p>
<p>I may wind up having to take this book down, due to potential issues
related to the <em>perception</em> of gambling. Additionally, my blunt goal
of trying to get Craft Poker Co.'s valuation to $100MM might cause
trouble.  The easiest solution to these problems is to remove this
document from <code>ctm.github.io</code>, but to keep the repository of its
source available so that anyone who wants to can see what I've said
previously.</p>
<p>Craft Poker Co. has no intention to violate any laws or regulations,
or to cause liability problems for anyone.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="preface"><a class="header" href="#preface">Preface</a></h1>
<p>I have hastily written this document and it is not fit for <em>general</em>
consumption.</p>
<p>On April 18th, 2019, I began writing
<a href="https://ctm.github.io/docs/players_manual/">mb2</a>: a set of poker
software, comprising a server, client and various libraries shared
between the two. I have had three friends invest in Craft Poker
Co. and I anticipate many more will do so, albeit probably through an
equity crowdfunding portal.</p>
<p>When I started work, I planned on &quot;quickly&quot; generating a
proof-of-concept with a traditional emphasis on minimal viable product
(MVP) features. My plan was to raise money so I could pay people to do
the things that I either couldn't do, or I'd do poorly or that could
be done by someone much less expensive than myself. I had no intention
of creating even the MVP solo.</p>
<p>However, as I was doing that, covid-19 struck and as I was waiting it
out I did more of the things I had planned on not doing. Additionally,
I added obscure features that were not required for a minimally viable
product and deferred features that were. As such, more than three
years later the software is lop-sided, with a lot of cool features,
but with an unstyled (and that's a polite way of putting it) user
interface.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="executive-summary"><a class="header" href="#executive-summary">Executive Summary</a></h1>
<p>My goal is to get Craft Poker Co.'s valuation to $100MM<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Initial revenue through </p>
<ul>
<li>craftpoker.com play-money site</li>
<li>white labeled play-money sites</li>
<li>partnerships (again, using play-money)</li>
</ul>
<p>I anticipate eventual revenue through real money sites, but the
regulatory hurdles for that are steep and numerous. The initial
bootstrapping of Craft Poker Co. will done purely through play-money
business, where we hope to become the acknowledged world leader of
play-money poker.  During this time, regulations will change. They may
loosen in some locales and may tighten in others.</p>
<p>No money raised via the equity crowdfunding portal will be spent
developing, or in any other way supporting, directly or indirectly,
gambling (i.e., real money play).  However, after Craft Poker Co. has
become the industry leader in play-money poker, it is likely that it
will have the revenue to thoroughly investigate the regulations, current
and proposed, and determine the feasibility of supporting real-money
play in whichever, if any, locales it can do so legally and profitably.</p>

<p>This nice round number is akin to <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=79879#id220546">running a hundred
miler</a>. I.e.,
it's not a sprint and it's not even a marathon.  As such, it takes a
different amount of time and preparation than either.</p>

<h2 id="truly-social-really-fun"><a class="header" href="#truly-social-really-fun">Truly social, really fun</a></h2>
<p>While Craft Poker Co. is the company that encompasses all forms of
monetization of <a href="https://ctm.github.io/docs/players_manual/">mb2</a>,
craftpoker.com will be a site dedicated to friendly but competitive
poker for <a href="https://ctm.github.io/docs/players_manual/fun_money.html">Fun
Money</a>
(i.e. a way of keeping score).</p>
<h2 id="possible-details"><a class="header" href="#possible-details">Possible details</a></h2>
<p>None of what is written here is guaranteed. The overall plan of having
craftpoker.com be supported via membership fees and not selling
information, advertising or selling Fun Money is unlikely to change.</p>
<p>Craftpoker.com will likely allow people to play for free, either solo
or as a member of a single club. Paying members will likely be able to
create their own clubs or simply belong to more than one pre-existing
club.</p>
<p>Craftpoker.com will not sell anyone's information and will collect as
little information as possible. Club managers will be in charge of how
Fun Money is allocated for their club. Free players playing solo will
only be able to gain a certain amount of free chips per some duration
so that there will be some incentive for free players to play to win
and not simply to spew chips.</p>
<p>The fee structure that I propose is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you play for free and are not a member of a club, you are only
limited to events (tournaments and ring games) that allow free
players, which will be a small fraction of what's dealt on
craftpoker.com.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you play for free and are a member of the club, you can play
everything a free solo player can play and anything that the club
manager allows you to play in that club. Club managers will typically
have a limit on the number of players in their club and will be able
to kick club members out at will (although not in the middle of a
tournament). If you are kicked out of a club craftpoker.com will remember
your club statistics, but they will not be available until you are
re-instated.  If you want to play in a different club, you can choose
to leave the club you're in when you're accepted to that other club.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you pay $5/month, you can be in as many clubs simultaneously as
you want and your statistics remain available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, your $5/month allows you to organize one club and to have
nine other members in that club. As a club organizer you will be able to
choose whether to admit others and to kick them out (although not in
the middle of a tournament).  If you want your club to be larger, you
can pay $5<em>N/month to allow your club to have 10</em>N simultaneous members.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The above is hastily worded, subject to change, etc., but the basic idea
is that people will be able to play for free, but it's probably more fun
to play as a member of at least one club.</p>

<p>There are other ways Craft Poker Co.'s software can be used other than
